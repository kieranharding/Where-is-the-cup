This is a little illustration of which NHL hockey teams have won the
most Stanley Cup championships. Circles are sized based on how many 
times the Cup has been won, which makes it easy to find Montr√©al.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
cups <- read.csv('./cupcount.csv')

leaflet(cups) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    # addMarkers() %>%
    addCircles(radius = ~ cups * 10000, 
               popup = ~paste(name, cups, sep=": "), 
               weight = 1)
```
